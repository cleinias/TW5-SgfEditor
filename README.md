# TW5-SgfEditor

TW5-SgfEditor is a widget plugin for [TiddlyWiki 5](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5) that turns a tiddler into a GUI capable of showing and editing a Go game recorded in SGF format.

It is based on the excellent [besogo](http://yewang.github.io/besogo/), an embeddable SGF editor/viewer.
