This plugin provides a `<$sgfEditor>` widget for visualizing and editing Go games stored in sgf format in a dedicated viewer.

The sgf record of the game is stored in a dedicated tiddler with its `type` field set to `text/vnd.tiddlywiki.sgf`.

The plugin is based on the [[besogo library by Ye Wang|http://yewang.github.io/besogo/]].
