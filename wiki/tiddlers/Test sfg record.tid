C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: howdy
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: have a good game
cleinias: Hello and thanks for the game

;B[kj]
;W[dd]
C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: yeah, no worries. 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: So how long have you been playing for?
cleinias: I learnt the rules (quite) a few years ago, read a couple of books but never got any good. Started again last week 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: right on

;B[jd]
;W[dk]
C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: yeah, it takes time and a considerable investment in studying to get to SDK ranks 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: of course.. some people have more of an aptitude than other... I've got 16 years or so invested so far, so I guess I'd be considered a slow learner

C[cleinias: So if this were not a teaching game I would resign as continuing seems rather pointless, since there is no hope to save my black stones and everything else is pretty much yours already. But perhaps you think there is something i may  still learn from the review if we continue?learn

;B[fm]
C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: well it's up to you. You're right that the group cannot live. 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: we can continue and something might come up, or just review what we have. 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: \[object Object\]

C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: pretty tricky eh? you know where you went wrong?
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: the problem with making this shape is that it opens up the weakness at A. . From move 59: 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: I think just descending like this is enough to live.. From move 59: A11 A10 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: playing like this is a safe way to make life as well . From move 59: A11 B12 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: (and probably the better way)
cleinias: right, I saw the porblemn with the weakness at B12 as soon as  you played it. It would never occurred to me to play at B12 first, I must say. What would have been your answer?, 
cleinias: I can't quite see how I can live with that move
cleinias: Thismove  is pretty bad. My thinking was that I need to defend B10 while creating the possibbility oof an eye. Did not work
cleinias: And this is likely a bigger nistake. I should have seen that his B12 was preparing/threatening an atari at B11

C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: 1. From move 59: A11 B12 A10 B11 F13 D13 G13 A11 E13 D12 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: 2. From move 59: A11 B12 A10 B11 D13 D12 F13 C13 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: 3. From move 59: A11 B12 A10 B11 C13 D13 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: There's no way white can kill 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: no, b12 was the vital point 
cleinias: Ok, I get it now. 
cleinias: but from the situationa at move 58, right after your B9, how do you see that B12 is the vital point? are you playing ahead  or is there a shape you/I should be able to recognize? 
]
;B[kc]
C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: well there's the tigers mouth shape here . From move 58: B12 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: even just connecting is a good shape though 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: there's rules for like L groups... haven't fully memorized them myself though, so I am probably not the most qualified teacher for that 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: this is an L group . From move 58: B12 B12 B11

C[cleinias: You don't say
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: this one doesn't look promising though 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: this looks more promising

C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: because of this move 
cleinias: indeed

C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: good thought, but this was the tricky move. 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: what if I play.... 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: this?
]
;W[ml]
C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: actually... I lied. This might be okay 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: I still think this is safer though . From move 82: N2 
cleinias: So this?
]
;B[mk]
C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: you don't have to throw in. I thought It was dead, but turning was just fine 
]
;W[lf]
C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: but yeah, nice job living 
cleinias: It's not obvious to me that the group is alive without the throw in. I would have to play it out
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: 4. From move 84: M4 N4 N5 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: 5. From move 84: M4 N3 N4 N1 M1 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: white can't limit you to 1 eye 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: even if white turns it into a ko... it doesn't help, it's a loosing ko. From move 84: M4 N4 N3 M11 M10 M3 N5 
cleinias: Ok, but in all variations black plays M4. I can't just walk away without responding to your move inside, can i? 
cleinias:  Your N2, I mean
]
;B[kd]
C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: well... as it stands right now, there's IS a possibility for me to turn it into a seki.

;W[mh]
;B[mi]
C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: be careful 
cleinias: yep
]
;W[mj]
C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: this avoid seki / ko battle . From move 88: N4

C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: ko battle it is ^_^

C[🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: no, definitley not very many ko threats

🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: g13 maybe

C[cleinias: Yep, I could not think of anything else. 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: well, maybeG10 is a good threat 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: but still, might be a loosing battle 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: regardless, it was an interesting ko 
cleinias: What would the threat be at G10? to make a living group with the G7-H7 and J8-J9 stones?
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: white has to answer here . From move 110: G10 H9 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: if not, black kills . From move 110: G10 M4 H9 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: as a ko threat it's good, but unless you win the ko, while also saving the top right, it's not real beneficial 
cleinias: Ah, didn't see that one!
cleinias: right
cleinias: Let's stop it here, I think I have enough to think about.
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: alright, sounds good. 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: hope it helped a little 
cleinias: But off the top off your  head, would you say there is a chance to make a living group in the center left?
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: It was a good game. 
cleinias: It definitely helped, thanks
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: no
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: I would say it's not possible 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: even if yo uused C6 as a ko
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: wihte would probably play something like this . From move 112: C6 D6 C5 B3 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: and your base is gone 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: c6 as a ko threat**
cleinias: AH, ok. 
cleinias: BTW, how do you do that slick thing of creating a variation and then referring to it like you just did?
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: if you go into 'analyze game' on the right side of the screen 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: while you're int here, if you make a variation, under  it is a box you can type into, with a share button to the right 
cleinias: Ah, I had missed that, thanks
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: yep, no problem 
cleinias: Thanks for the game. I am going to study your review
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: yep, anytime. 
🌀🍁oopsImStoned🍁🌀: have a good one
